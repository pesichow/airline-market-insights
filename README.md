Approach Description: I used a free API (aviationstack) to fetch live flight data, processed it using pandas to identify popular routes, and visualized it with Plotly. I integrated Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers summarization pipeline to extract AI-generated insights. The app is built with Streamlit for easy deployment and use.
